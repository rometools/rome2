# Welcome to the Rome 2 construction site

This is a temporary repository for initial discussions and development of the new version of [Rome](https://github.com/rometools/rome). It will be merged into the main repository once we're ready to ship an alpha version.


## Why exactly are we doing this?
See https://github.com/rometools/rome/issues/353 for the explanation and a rough plan.
